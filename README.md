Host files on IPFS and manage directory through Ethereum blockchain

### What we have done
1. Setup IPFS and understand how it works
2. Upload content to IPFS (video and image)
3. Access files through IPFS

### Example hashes

### What we need to do:
1. Mapping multiple entries of hashes into a database
2. Hide the hashes, so only the message sender can get the hash back
3. The message sender can grant access to hashes of files in this database

single use contract branch purpose
1 to implement a single use contract from our base contract  
2 to allow for owner to give a weight to someone and revoke it and require this weight to get the hash.
